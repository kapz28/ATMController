# ATMController
This was a ATM program that I created for a coding challenge that I received.
There are three accounts that are available through the ATM which are as follows:

## Accounts
### Kapilan Satkunanathan:
account number: 1234567890
pin: 1234

### Bear Robotics:
account number: 1234567891
pin: 1235

### Elon Musk:
account number: 1234567892
pin: 1236

# Deployment
run ATMcontroller.exe, if that doesn't work then build ATMcontroller.cpp and then run the ATMcontroller.exe

#### Note I didn't create header files for account and admin class to create ease of deployment so it's not hard to deploy
